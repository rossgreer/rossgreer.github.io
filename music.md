# Music & AI

My research extends into the intersection of artificial intelligence and music, exploring how machine learning can understand, generate, and collaborate with human creativity.

## Media

**Interview with Tiffany Poon**
A conversation exploring the intersection of AI and music with concert pianist Tiffany Poon on her *Together With Classical* series.

## Teaching

**CSE 190: Machine Learning for Music and Audio**
Previously taught at UC San Diego, covering machine learning techniques applied to music information retrieval, audio signal processing, and generative models.

## Creative Practice

Beyond research, I am an active musician, composer, and performer. Music serves as both a creative outlet and a testing ground for ideas about human-machine collaboration.
