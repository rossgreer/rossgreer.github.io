# Music & AI

My research extends into the intersection of artificial intelligence and music, exploring how machine learning can understand, generate, and collaborate with human creativity.

## Research

**AI & Visual Cues for Musical Improvisation**
Presented at the 10th Improtech Conference. This work explores how AI systems can interpret and respond to visual cues during live musical performance.

**Restoring Nonverbal Communication in Virtual Settings**
Research on using AI to recover the subtle nonverbal signals lost in video-mediated communication, featured in [NewScientist](https://www.newscientist.com/).

**Interview with Tiffany Poon**
A conversation exploring the intersection of AI and music with concert pianist Tiffany Poon.

## Teaching

**CSE 190: Machine Learning for Music and Audio**
Previously taught at UC San Diego, covering machine learning techniques applied to music information retrieval, audio signal processing, and generative models.

## Creative Practice

Beyond research, I am an active musician and performer. Music serves as both a creative outlet and a testing ground for ideas about human-machine collaboration.
