<div class="bio">

I lead the **Mi³ Lab** (Machine Intelligence, Interaction, and Imagination) at UC Merced. My research applies computer vision and AI to enable safe autonomous driving, with a focus on:

- **Uncertainty quantification** in learning systems
- **Robustness** against rare events and open-world scenarios
- **Safety** in human-interactive systems
- **Data curation** and utility optimization

I received my Ph.D. from UC San Diego, where I was supervised by [Mohan Trivedi](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/Mohan/) at the [Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/). I also collaborated with [Shlomo Dubnov](http://music.ucsd.edu/~sdubnov/) through the Center for Research in Entertainment & Learning (CREL).
