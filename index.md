I lead the Mi³ Lab (Machine Intelligence, Interaction, and Imagination) at UC Merced. My research applies computer vision and AI to enable safe autonomous driving. I focus on building systems that can handle the unpredictable nature of real-world driving: quantifying uncertainty, responding robustly to rare events, and ensuring safety when humans and machines must collaborate.

Core research themes include:

- Uncertainty quantification in learning systems
- Robustness against rare events and open-world scenarios
- Safety in human-interactive systems
- Data curation and utility optimization

I received my Ph.D. from UC San Diego, where I was supervised by [Mohan Trivedi](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/Mohan/) at the [Laboratory for Intelligent & Safe Automobiles (LISA)](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/). I also collaborated with [Shlomo Dubnov](http://music.ucsd.edu/~sdubnov/) through the Center for Research in Entertainment & Learning (CREL), exploring the intersection of AI and music. Together, we co-authored [*Deep and Shallow: Machine Learning in Music and Audio*](https://www.routledge.com/) and presented research on AI-assisted musical improvisation and restoring nonverbal communication in virtual settings.
